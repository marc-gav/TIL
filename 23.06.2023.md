# DNS exfiltration
I was solving a forensic's challenge in picoCTF that consisted of a Wireshark packet capture. I got stuck because I wasn't aware of this hacking technique and I check a really nice youtube explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDY6nW4yNBM.

DNS exfiltration consists of hiding data in DNS requests. The idea is to encode the data in the subdomain of a DNS request. For example:
```
subdomain.domain.com -> subdomain = leaked_document_contents
leaked_document_contents.domain.com
```

Obviously it is not possible to send the entire document in a single DNS request, so the idea is to split the document in chunks and send each chunk in a different DNS request. The chunks are encoded in base64 and the subdomain is the base64 encoded chunk.

That was the solution of the CTF challenge. I used https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ to decode the base64 chunks and I got the flag.
